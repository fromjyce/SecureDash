# SecureDash

Welcome to SecureDash, a cutting-edge project designed to enhance Smart Grid security through an advanced Intrusion Detection System (IDS). By integrating machine learning techniques and real-time data processing, SecureDash aims to protect critical infrastructure from cyber threats, ensuring the resilience and reliability of modern energy grids.

## Overview on SecureDash

SecureDash offers a comprehensive solution for safeguarding Smart Grid systems against cyber threats. Here's an overview of what can be achieved using this project:

- **Advanced Intrusion Detection**: SecureDash leverages a hybrid deep learning model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) to detect anomalies and cyber threats in real-time.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: The system captures and processes network packets, enabling continuous monitoring of Smart Grid communication networks.
- **Threat Mitigation**: SecureDash integrates robust threat mitigation strategies to protect the grid from Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and other cyber threats.
- **Data Visualization**: Predictions and anomaly detections are visualized in real-time using Power BI, providing actionable insights to security teams.
- **Database Management**: All predictions are stored in a MySQL database for further analysis and historical review.
- **Scalability and Flexibility**: The system is designed to be scalable, allowing for deployment across various Smart Grid settings and integration with existing IDS/IPS infrastructure.

In summary, SecureDash enhances the security of Smart Grids by providing a robust, machine learning-driven intrusion detection framework, ensuring the uninterrupted operation of critical energy infrastructure.

## Structure of the Repository
